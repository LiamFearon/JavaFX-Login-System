# JavaFX-Login-System

## Introduction
This program is my first attempt of creating a GUI application using Java as my main programming language.
I have used JavaFX to create my GUI, assisted by SceneBuilder and Eclipse

## How it works
The program consists of a single window giving the user a form to log in. When the "Log In" button is pressed, a text file is used to import user data. With this, the program checks the user input credentials agaisnt valid credentials from said text file, and returns a result to the user that is dependant on if the log in credentials are correct.

## Further Work
To improve this program I believe the following paths of development should be taken
* Use of MySQL database instead of plain text file
* Replacement of Log In block text with something more presentable
* Limit resizeability
